<p><i>Bid strategy #1 - If you want your site to be displayed first in your particular region you won't have to bid so high as to be first globally. You might not even have to purchase in the highest price slot to be first in your region and category. In fact, if you are in a region without much competition you might even be able to purchase a position in the very lowest, micro-price slot and it will be enough to elevate you to the number one spot whenever someone filters results to just your region.
<p><i>Bid strategy #2 - Buy early. You can jump ahead off all the other free links in your category by buting even the lowest, micro-priced price slot.  

<p><i>Bid strategy #3 - As more links populate a given price slot it pays to be the first to buy in the next higher price slot because you will be first on the page (until someone else buys in yet another higher price slot).</i></p>
<p><i>Bid strategy #4 - While this system enables a certain level of competition and bidding (so we can pay our partner websites for their traffic contributions), it is possible for a bidder to allow the listing to "float" up and down in the listings page and only have to check back every once in a while to see their status and position in the category (they can also just view the BungeeBones web directory in any one of the remote locations or at BungeeBones.com to see it also). By bidding into the number one spot, for example, there would have to be twenty others to come and pay twice as much as you before your link was off the first page.</i></p>
<p><i>Bid strategy #5 - Gain a major price advantage (50%) by adding the BungeeBones web directory to your website and become your own best web advertising customer.</i></p>
