<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>TERMS SPECIFIC TO BUYERS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
BUYERS agree to not ACCEPT a SELLER'S offer unless they are able to get to the SELLER'S bank and make the deposit within the time period specified in the SALES AGREEMENT. 
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
BUYERS agree to not submit a \"Successful Deposit Report\" until AFTER they have actually deposited the correct amount of CASH (no checks, money orders, travelers checks etc) into the BUYER'S bank account and they actually have the deposit receipt from the bank IN THEIR POSSESSION! 
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
It is suggested that the BUYER uses a smart phone with Internet capability and 1) Wait to accept the SELLER's offer until they are at the bank lobby or drive thru 2) then make the deposit, get their receipt, get a business card or ID of the tellerand 3) THEN use the smart phone to again access the BungeeBones web page to report the successful deposit. Depending on how long it takes the teller to actually process the transaction then both the acceptance of the offer and the report by the buyer can be accomplished in as little as a few moments.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h2>TERMS SPECIFIC TO SELLERS</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the SELLER'S sole responsibilty to check their bank records and verify that a deposit had indeed been made after a BUYER has submitted to BungeeBones a Successful Deposit Report and said report had been forwarded to the SELLER'S EMAIL of record. 
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
It is the SELLER'S sole responsibilty to REPORT a false deposit using the Report A False Deposit Report On The Buyer/Force Arbitration* link in their Exchange Menu which will result in the permanent cancellation of the automatic transfer of the credits to the BUYER. NOTE: There will be a 5% Arbitration Fee charged to the SELLER IF it is found the BUYER has sufficient proof of a deposit and the SELLER has wrongfully withheld transfer of the credits to the BUYER.
<p>&nbsp;</p><p> 
The SELLER acknowledges the risk that if a BUYER were to submit a FALSE Successful Deposit Report and the SELLER does not check their bank account to verify the deposit within the time they alloted themselves in the listing agreement then the funds will automatically and irreversibly be transferred to the buyer at the end of said time period. The SELLER agrees to assume ALL RISKS associated with a BUYER making a false report of a deposit and the SELLER not making a timely discovery of the fraudulent report. There will be no reimbursement of advertising credits to SELLERS that do not verify a Successful Deposit Report by the BUYER.
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The BungeeBones website will send an email to the SELLER'S EMAIL ADDRESS ON RECORD - $email - when the BUYER submits their Successful Deposit Report. The SELLER acknowledges they have TESTED their email to make sure they receive it properly (i.e that it is not landing in the spam filters, does have the correct address etc.) 
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no way of knowing the time of day when a BUYER makes a deposit so it is up to the SELLER to allocate themselves plenty of time to verify the deposit
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The SELLER agrees to make every effort to complete the transfer to the BUYER (after payment) in a timely manner by manually (i.e. clicking a link in their Exchange Menu) transferring the advertising credits themselves rather than waiting for the time limit to elapse and having the system transfer the funds automatically.
