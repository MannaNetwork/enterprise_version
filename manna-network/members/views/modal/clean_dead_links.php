<h1>Earn Bitcoin To Purchase Better Link Position</h1></a>

<p>After you register (and confirm your email and then log back in) you will add the information about your website and, during that process, there is a "block" or frame that lists your website's competition or, as we say, your "peers". They are the other websites already listed in the same category as what you are currently in. 

<p>You can earn Bitcoin to improve your site's placement by reporting dead or broken links, inappropriate sites and even miscategorized websites. Just visit the sites by clicking their links and, if defective, just click the link below their link details for reporting them as a defective link.

<h3>We will credit your account $3 (Three dollars US) worth of Bitcoin* for any defective links you find and report in your category!</h3>
<p style="font-size:smaller">*How much Bitcoin you actually get will be determined from the weighted average price as reported by MtGox.com at the time we process your report.</p>

<p>Other conditions are <br>1) that the Bitcoin can only be used for advertising (i.e. they won't be sent out to a wallet address) and <br>2) that the final decision whether a site is miscategorized is solely at the discretion of BungeeBones.
