Can you add webpages to your website?</li>
<li><div class="acc-content">
Does your hosting come with PHP?
<p>Because every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables  on a given system. 
</p>
<p>Create a blank page on your site (preferrably in a folder named as you entered in the configuration you just performed but not necessarily) and copy and paste the following code into it. Name and save it as anything you like, just being sure to use the .php extension at the end of the file name (eg. phpinfo.php). Then open the page with your browser.</p>
<table width="600" Border="1" bgcolor="cccccc"><tr><td>&lt;?php <br />echo phpinfo();
/&gt;</td></tr></table>
</div></li>

<li><div class="acc-content">
<p>
Does your server support cURL?.
<p>To keep things simple, we supplied you with code to meet the most widely used server settings which includes use of something called "cURL".  We need to verify that cURL is enabled. Having verified you have PHP installed in the previous step, search the PHPInfo page for the following section and verify cURL is enabled. Open the page with your browser. Click "Edit", click "Find" and enter the search term "CURL support" (without the quotes).
.</p>
<table width="600" border ="1" bgcolor="cccccc"><tr><td>
<br />curl
<br />CURL support enabled
<br />CURL Information libcurl/7.10.6 OpenSSL/0.9.7a ipv6 zlib/1.2.0.7
</td></tr></table>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="acc-content">
<p>
If you don't have php available the script will not work on your website. If cURL is not enabled we suggest you first contact your hosting company to see if they will enable it. Most hosting companies enable it for security reasons anyway. If they don't then contact us and we have different code to accomodate some other settings</li>

						<b>Choose Your Code Format</b>			
						After entering the necessary AdvertiPage customising information and submitting the form we will display the code for two different methods that produce the Advertipage opn your website.

							<ol>
								<li>
					 		One format we deliver to you is the directory in a complete page template, ready to install but without your graphics and menu of course. The areas are well marked, however, so you can easily insert your own.
							</li>
							<li>
					 		The second format we deliver to you is the directory in two sections of code, ready to install into the &lt;head&gt;. and &lt;body&gt; sections of one of your own page templates.
							</li>
							</ol>
					</LI>
				
				

<LI><b>Installing Format One</b>




						<ul>
										
										<LI>			
										<b>Save A Blank Page To Your Web Directory Folder</b>		
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
											If you have not created the folder in your website to hold the AdvertiPage yet now is a good time to do so.  It, and the template page you are about to save in it must both be named as you name them in the configuration form. The page you save must have a php extension.
											</div>
										</div>
										</LI>
										<LI>					
										<b>Copy and Paste The Code We Deliver To That Page</b>
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
												Our template produces a standard 3 column with a header and footer web page. You will be able to replace those sections by copying them from pages on your website and pasting that into the appropriate sections on our page, leaving the web directory code behind and in between your pastings.	</div>
										</div>
										</LI>
										<LI>		
										<b>Copy And Paste Your Menus, Pictures etc Into the Page</b>			
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
									 		By comparing the various text displayed on the AdvertiPage to what is in the code you can locate the various sections of the page</b>
											</div>
											<div class="acc-content">
											Exception - the code before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag in your supplied page should not be altered except for CSS style information. 
											</div>
											<div class="acc-content">
											Exeception 2 - nothing between the code starting with "$file="http://" to "echo $data" should be changed	</div>
										</div>
										</li>
						</ul>
				</li>





				<LI><b>Installing Format Two</b>




						<ul>
										<LI>	
										<b>You Need A "Template" Of Your Webpage</b>			
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
											If you don't already have a template of your webpages a real simple way to get one is to use one of your most basic web pages on your site and copy its source code. Open the one you want to use with your browser and click the "View" link in the browser nav bar and the "Source" or "Page Source" link depending on which browser you use.Copy the source code into a text editor . We will paste our two sections of code into that page and replace the pages current content with our new directory.
											</div>
										</div>
										</LI>
										<LI>			
										<b>Save The Template Page To Your Web Directory Folder</b>		
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
											If you have not created the folder in your website to hold the AdvertiPage yet now is a good time to do so.  It, and the template page you are about to save in it must both be named as you name them in the configuration form. The page you save must have a php extension.
											</div>
										</div>
										</LI>
										<LI>	
										<b>Copy And Paste The First Section Of Code</b>				
										(i.e.The Dynamic Page Title, Description and Meta Tag Section)
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
												All of those items reside in between the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tags toward the top of your template page We are going to replace everything on your template page from the opening &lt;head&gt; tag back to the very first line and character of code. We are going to leave the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag though, and perhaps some of your own style information if you like. You cannot leave the &lt;title&gt;, &lt;description&gt;, nor &lt;keyword&gt; tags however. If you do, the dynamic page feature will not work for those items and all your pages will have the same ones. After configuring your script and submitting the form copy the first section from the code we deliver to you and paste it into your template page as described above, being sure to leave the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag in place.
											</div>
										</div>
										</LI>
										<LI>		
										<b>Copy And Paste The Second Section Of Code</b>			
										<div class="acc-section">
											<div class="acc-content">
									 		This sectioon of code produces the AdvertiPage Web Directory</b>
											</div>
											<div class="acc-content">
											Locate the opening &lt;body&gt; tag and the closing &lt;/body&gt; body tag in your template. 
											</div>
											<div class="acc-content">
											You can paste this second section of code over any content in your template that is in between those two body tags.
											</div>
										</div>
										</li>
						</ul>
				</li>
				<LI>		
				<b>Check For Errors</b>			
				<div class="acc-section">
					<div class="acc-content">
					Open the page in your browser.  You should have the main category page displaying the categories
					</div>
					<div class="acc-content">
					If so, click on one of the categories to open up its sub-categories.</div>
					<div class="acc-content">
					You should have a page displaying the sub-categories and links that have been submitted to it previously	</div>
	
					<div class="acc-content">
					If everything is working, congratulations! You now have a web directory for your web site visitors and potential income.</div>
	
					<div class="acc-content">
					If not, please consult the documentation or the forums. It usually is some simple problem and there are just a few simple fixes to get it working.</div>
