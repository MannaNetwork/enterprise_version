			At its core, BungeeBones is a php script developed by Robert Lefebure to add Web 2.0 interactivity and power to web sites through its "distributed" web directory script. 
			</li>
			<li>
			After that it is a community of webmasters and website owners that use the script and cooperate to promote each other's websites and earn income.

			BungeeBones is completely different from other web directories and link exchanges- BungeeBones combines the concepts of Web 2.0, Pay Per Click (the most used web advertising format), link exchange (the time tested foundation of the web) and web directories (a common method of organizing) into a completely new model of website advertising and promotion.

				On a tight advertising budget? Want to test drive BungeeBones? Sign up in one of the many free (but lower) categories. The free status is guaranteed until the category reaches a population of 20.

			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				If there are fewer than 20 links within that region for that category the link is free! Certain businesses are regional in nature (coffee shops, barbers, auto dealers etc) and do not need "World Wide Web" advertising. BungeeBones has added "regional filters" to its mobile version ( a Yellow Page type directory built for cell phone users).  If there are not more than twenty in your region then your ad is still free even though there are more than twenty in the category (you won't be displayed 'globally" however).

			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				When a site that registered from your installed web directory becomes a paying advertising customer you will receive 50% of what they pay, even if they first signed up for the free link. Even if it takes them months or years to convert to a paid link you will still get commissions when they begin paying.

			You Do No Selling - BungeeBones Does the Marketing For You
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				As each category fills beyond the free population level BungeeBones conducts real low/no  pressure marketing for them to convert their current free links there into paid links. When a link that signed up from your website converts to a paid link BungeeBones will still pay you half the ad fee as a commission. So even free links that sign up through your site and later convert to paid links will earn you commissions.

			Internet Advertising Is A Growth Industry
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				Every website can use more web traffic right? So the potential market for the BungeeBones Distributed Web Directory is huge. BungeeBones is working to establish itself as a unique method of traffic marketing and calls itself an "exit" portal. Install the directory and present your exiting visitor the option to visit our member's websites. BungeeBones bundles the traffic that would otherwise be leaving a website with no income generated for the website owner and bundles it with the other Network members' traffic into a marketable advertising product.

			Start Your Own Local "Yellow Pages" Directory
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				BungeeBones has just launched its mobile version which is designed to provide easy access to cell phone users. The migration to cell phones has made traditional "Yellow Page" advertising a lot less effective. After all, when was the last time you saw a cell phone user carrying around the Yellow pages with them? The world is just too big a place for BungeeBones to get into every locality and sell advertising to so the market in your area is wide open for this. Simply add the directory to your website and start directing local businesses to registering from your site. There will be a wide range of advertising needs, of course, and many will opt for free advertising but there will also be some that will want to compete for higher, paid positions. When they do, you earn commissions. Local competition can also grow in certain categories also.

			BungeeBones Is A Free Network Marketing Opportunity!
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				The network marketing concept was the only one that made sense for distributuing BungeeBones and getting it used by the masses. Network marketing businesses usually require that you pay an upfront fee to join their group to "earn the right" to sell their product. BungeeBones says that if you have a quality website launched with valuable content that people want then you already have invested enough to qualifyy to join our network.
				<p>Network marketing means you get paid residual commissions and income on those that become selling members themselves. It is another way of BungeeBones saying "Thank you!" and compensating you for hosting our Distributed Web Directory on your site and sending your web traffic to our members. By getting more websites to add the directory to their site you have helped build the total traffic volume that is using the BungeeBones directory and you get to share in the growth.</p>

			Steps To Add Your Link To BungeeBones
				<ol>	
				<LI>					
				<div class="acc-section">
					<div class="acc-content">
					Use the combination of our directory and the Regional Filters dropdown menus below to migrate to the category you want to add your link to. Notice the one or two numbers beside each category. They represent the link population (i.e. your competition) in the category and the combined total in its subcategories respectively. Those totals will be updated for you if and/or when a regional filter is selected, reporting how many links there are in that category and THAT region.
					</div>
				</div>
				</LI>
				<LI>					
				<div class="acc-section">
					<div class="acc-content">
					If you feel adding regional filters to your link listing is a benefit then use the four dropdowns to select the LOWEST level region you would settle for your link to be displayed in. Note your link will be displayed at higher level regions if populations limits allow (i.e. a link in Los Angeles will be displayed in Californua requests if there are fewer than twenty links in that category in California). When you have arrived at the best location for your link, use the drop down menues to select the best regional filters that apply to your website and/or business (if applicable). Notice the links that appear. Clicking a link will refresh the page and will display only the links from that region and catgegory. NOT SELECTING a region places your link in the "global" (World Wide Web) level.
					</div>
				</div>
				</LI>
				</LI>
				<LI>					
				<div class="acc-section">
					<div class="acc-content">
					If your category or region is not listed then proceed as normal and add your link to the "next-best" category and/or region anyway. Then, if you don't mind, drop us a quick note using our contact form along with your link url and your requested category or region and we will do everything we can to accomodate your request. If the suggestion is approved we are glad to move your link into the new category/region for you.

					If you are satisfied that you have arrived where you want to place your link then scroll down to the very bottom of the page to add your link and other information to the form, perhaps noticing the other links in the category as you scroll. This is an excellent time to volunteer and help BungeeBones achieve the top quality it is aiming for by visiting the sites and rating them according to their relevancy to the category. Not only does "Peer Rating" help improve the directory's quality but you also get to see other websites and what features they have.
