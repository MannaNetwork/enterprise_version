<h1>A Quick Easy Test That Shows Your Server Is Set To Handle Our Script</h1>
<h1>Outline Of This Procedure</h1>
<h2>You will:</h2>
<ul><li>Create and name the installation folder on your hosting server as you named it in the previous form</li>
<li>Download, then upload and install our "ugly" demo into that folder and rename it to what you told us in the previous form</li>
<li>Make one small configuration change to that file</li>
<li>Click the links, test the directory, and make sure the directory works</li></ul>
<h2>Let's Start - Step 1 - Rename The Demo Folder To The Installation Directory/Location</h2> 


<p style="text-align:left; ">Now go to your website and rename the demo folder there the same as what you specified in the previous form, making sure that the naming and the spelling are identical to what you entered. If you happened to have changed your mind about the folder or file name don't worry as it is all editable by closing this modal and re-entering the previous modal/form. 
<h2>Step 2 - Change The File Name</h2> 
<p style="text-align:left; ">Next, you need to rename the file in it named "demo.php" to the same file name (ie. the file name you entered with the .php extension) as you told us it would be. 

<h2>Step 3 - Make One Small Configuration Change To That File</h2> 
<p style="text-align:left; ">You still will have to make one, small configuration change to the page you just renamed. In the seventh line of code in the page there is a line that reads "//verify that the affiliate number below is yours to insure your affiliate credit and payments" 

and just below that on line three it has - 
$affiliate_num = 3112 ; . 

<p style="text-align:left; "><b>Change that number (3112) to YOUR AFFILIATE NUMBER for your site which IS  ...  <? echo $_GET['link_id']; ?>   ...


<h2>A Review Of All The Above Steps</h2>
<p style="text-align:left; ">To review, after you uploaded and unzipped the file on your site, in the location you specified, and named as you entered, renamed the demo.php file, and changed the affiliate number on it to yours --- the web directory should work. 

<h2>Double Check</h2>
<p style="text-align:left; "> Making sure the web directory is working properly requires a little more than just viewing it. Open the page in a browser and be sure to click the categories on the main page because it may look normal but still not be functioning properly. If not, there may be a conflict with our code and your hosting company settings. If it is NOT working, DON'T go any further. Go to the TROUBLESHOOTING section below and/or contact us.
