<tr><td style="text-align: left;">The template produces for you an entire web page in addition to the BungeeBones web directory and its categories.  It is not meant to be pretty. It is designed so that you can easily see what parts of the page are where BungeeBones code is installed and where you can enter the parts of your website such as your header pictures and logos, your menus and sidebars and your footer. Your template/directory will be fully functional however. To get the template click the "Template" button below.</td><td style="text-align: left;">We also provide the code in what we call "Bare Bones" and it comes in two parts or snippets of code. One code goes into your "head" area but does not replace your closing head tag, leaving room for your style info and some meta tags. If all that makes sense to you then it is  faster and easier to customise it to your website than Option 1. Use one of your own pages as a template and insert BungeeBones into it. To get the BareBones version just click the BareBones button below</td</tr>
