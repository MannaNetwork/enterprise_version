<p style="text-align:left; ">You need to tell us where you are going to (or have already) install(ed) the web directory on your website.  You can install the web directory in any location you like but for now, to keep it simple, we are going to ask that you place it in a web folder one level under your website root folder. Using the YourSite.com domain as an example (<b>replace YourSite.com with your own actual domain</b>), then, if you want your web directory in a folder named "links" on your website you will enter that desired name here and will eventually ( in Step 2) create a new folder at YourSite.com/links. If you want it in a folder named "web_directory" you will create a new folder at YourSite.com/web_directory, etc. Correctly matching the configuration to the actual install location is <b>absolutely crucial</b> for the web directory to work properly. So go to the <a style="color: navy;" href="widget_add_from_install.php?link_selected='. $_GET['link_id'].'" title="Install Location" >Install Location Form</a> now and configure where you will be installing the web directory, then go on to Step 2.';
