</div>
<div class="thelanguage">

		<div class="acc-content">
			<ul class="acc" id="nested">
			<li>
			At its core, BungeeBones is a website promotion and traffic generating system. 
			</li>
<li>
			It is a Web 2.0 php web directory script developed by Robert Lefebure to add interactive website advertising and promotion to web sites through its "distributed" web directory script. 
			</li>
			<li>
			It is a community of webmasters and website owners that use the script and cooperate to promote each other's websites in a manner similar to a link exchange.
			</li><li>
			It is a website income generator through a system similar to, but still quite different from, Pay Per Click
			</li>
			<li>
			It is a combination of tried and well proven web strategies such as link exchange, web directories, reciprocal linking, Search Engine Optimisation and Pay Per Click

			<ul class="acc" id="nested">
			<li>
				BungeeBones is completely different from other web directories because it is "distributed" and gets installed (complete with links and categories) on many web sites. The BungeeBones AdvertiPage combines the concepts of Web 2.0, Pay Per Click (the most used web advertising format), link exchange (the time tested foundation of the web) and web directories into a completely new model of website advertising and promotion. As each new distributed web directory gets installed it acts as a "portal" into the network of advertising websites. We can say that its web traffic is now added to the pool of traffic from the other websites that an advertised link in the directory is exposed too. One new distributed web directory after another each add to what in print media is called the "circulation" numbers. As that number increases so too does the value (and the cost to the advertiser) of advertising in the network. Since each distributed web directory is a 50-50 partner with BungeeBones0 they get the benefit of that growth as well through higher future income and web traffic.

<p style=" font-size: 60%">*The webmasters that install and hosts the distributed web directory have complete control of whether to display free links or not and , if so, for how long (afterall, it is their traffic).  Though we strongly encourage them to offer free links to all we cannot guarantee every distributed web directory will display free links. They do display all paid links however.</p>

You get displayed more prominently in your location. A great feature for local oriented businesses (coffee shops, barbers, auto dealers etc) that do not need "World Wide Web" advertising. AdvertiPage has added "regional filters" to its mobile version ( a Yellow Page type directory built for cell phone users).

			No Expiration Or Time Limits
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				<p style = "font-size:80%">When a site that registered from your installed web directory becomes a paying advertising customer you will receive 50% of what they pay, even if they first signed up for the free link. Even if it takes them months or years to convert to a paid link you will still get commissions when they begin paying.

			You Do No Selling - BungeeBones Does the Marketing For You
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				<p style = "font-size:80%">As each category fills beyond the free population level BungeeBones conducts real low/no  pressure marketing for them to convert their current free links there into paid links. When a link that signed up from your website converts to a paid link BungeeBones will still pay you half the ad fee as a commission. So even free links that sign up through your site and later convert to paid links will earn you commissions.

			Internet Advertising Is A Growth Industry
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				<p style = "font-size:80%">Every website can use more web traffic right? So the potential market for the BungeeBones Distributed Web Directory is huge. BungeeBones is working to establish itself as a unique method of traffic marketing and calls itself an "exit" portal. Install the directory and present your exiting visitor the option to visit our member's websites. BungeeBones bundles the traffic that would otherwise be leaving a website with no income generated for the website owner and bundles it with the other Network members' traffic into a marketable advertising product.

			Start Your Own Local "Yellow Pages" Directory
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				<p style = "font-size:80%">BungeeBones has just launched its mobile version which is designed to provide easy access to cell phone users. The migration to cell phones has made traditional "Yellow Page" advertising a lot less effective. After all, when was the last time you saw a cell phone user carrying around the Yellow pages with them? The world is just too big a place for BungeeBones to get into every locality and sell advertising to so the market in your area is wide open for this. Simply add the directory to your website and start directing local businesses to registering from your site. There will be a wide range of advertising needs, of course, and many will opt for free advertising but there will also be some that will want to compete for higher, paid positions. When they do, you earn commissions. Local competition can also grow in certain categories also.
				</div>
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
			BungeeBones Is A Free Network Marketing Opportunity!
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
				<p style = "font-size:80%">The network marketing concept was the only one that made sense for distributuing BungeeBones and getting it used by the masses. Network marketing businesses usually require that you pay an upfront fee to join their group to "earn the right" to sell their product. BungeeBones says that if you have a quality website launched with valuable content that people want then you already have invested enough to qualifyy to join our network.
				<p style = "font-size:80%">Network marketing means you get paid residual commissions and income on those that become selling members themselves. It is another way of BungeeBones saying "Thank you!" and compensating you for hosting our Distributed Web Directory on your site and sending your web traffic to our members. By getting more websites to add the directory to their site you have helped build the total traffic volume that is using the BungeeBones directory and you get to share in the growth.</p>

			Easy To Install
			<div class="acc-section">
				<div class="acc-content">
					<p style = "font-size:80%">The only skills necessary to install the directory are the ability to 1) create a file folder on your website 2)create or adapt an existing web page into a blank page template 3)be able to copy and paste the BungeeBones web directory code into that page template and 4)finally, be able to install links in your menus and/or webpages to the new template page.

There will be only two types of visitors to your distributed web directory - those with their own website and those without one. Since BungeeBones's product is web traffic both of us are interested in getting the former group to join BungeeBones. We do offer various levels of membership (including free) but when someone adds a distributed web directory too they are helping us grow and you receive your share of that growth.

Not only does "Peer Rating" help improve the directory's quality but you also get to see other websites and what features they have.

					Lastly, the script will present a confirmation page before final submittal. At that time it may also provide additional information, if applicable, such as the number of paid/free links in the category and/or the regions.
