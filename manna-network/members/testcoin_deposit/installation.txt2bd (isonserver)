Assuming you have the bitcoin server running on your VPS and assuming you have Apache, MySql, Php and Curl also installed 
there then the first step is to configure this script to connect to your database using the db2bbconfiga.php file in the 
db_cfg folder.

You will eventually need to create a db named testnet and use the included sql file to install the three tables (watching, 
archived, and move_to_cold tables). That can be done now or after configuring and testing your RPC JSon connection to the
Bitcoin server.

The easiest way to do that (test your RPC JSon) is to make the changes to the RPC user name and password in the test_bitcoin.php and the test_bitcoin_rpc.php 
files. 

First, make sure you configured RPC user and password in the bitcoin.conf file of the bitcoin server like this
server=1
daemon=1
testnet=1

rpcuser=CreateYourUserName
rpcpassword=CreateYourPassword$$$###***

THEN OPEN (IN A BROWSER) www.yourVPS.com/testbitcoin.php. Assuming the server is running it should display Bitcoin info.

Once the RPC connection is established with the bitcoin server then make the same configuration change towards the 
beginning of the classes/process_testnet_class.php page.

Install the database and tables (if you haven't already).

Install the index_os.php file (copy it from inside the REMOTE_SHARED_HOST_INDEX_FILE folder of the download) into your 
remote shared server website files. In that file there is one configuration that will send curl requests to the VPS and 
you need to insert the address there.

The script is currently fooled into believing you are an authenticated user of the shared server by a HARDCODING of 
a user id (user ID 1001). The user id will be used to create a unique account for that user (and from that unique account
the script will create unlimited new addresses for the user to submit Bitcoin payments to). You can make the script
create a new account for each of your authenticated users by making that CODING CHANGE to the 
index_os.php file and send a unique account number for each user. Each user, then, will get a unique address and (if they follow recomendations) will receive a unique address for each deposit they make. NOTE: They will receive a new address AFTER the script moves their deposit to another address or cold storage. Since that setting is configurable and currently set at 3 confirmations then the user can receive a new address after that and at approximately every 30 minutes (at ten minutes per confirmation)

Visit that page on your shared server from a browser. If everything is configured correctly then the page should display and address.
