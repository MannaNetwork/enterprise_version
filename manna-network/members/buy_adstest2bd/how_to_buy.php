<h2>How To Purchase Bitcoin</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">There are a number of ways that you can purchase Bitcoin (even from your local Walmart, 7-11 and Walgreens through Bit Instant) and more are constantly becoming available. Some of the most popular are <a target="_blank" href="http://MtGox.com">Mt. Gox</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://BitInstant.com">Bit Instant</a>,  <a target="_blank" href="https://localbitcoins.com">Local Bitcoins</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tradebitcoin.com/">Trade Bitcoin</a>

<p style="text-align:left;">You will need a <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet">Bitcoin wallet</a>, of course, but after you have your Bitcoin in your wallet you need to send some to your BungeeBones account. The minimum you would need to deposit to get started would be the "per-diem" times the number of remaining days in the month. If there is just one day left in the current month then the minimum fee would be the monthly fee/30. If it is the first day of the month then it would be the whole monthly fee. Any extra you deposit will remain in your account available for use the following month.



<p style="text-align:left;">BungeeBones is not automated enough yet that sending to that address gets credited immediately so, temporarily at least, we use an honor system that lets you tell us how much you are sending and we immediately make that amount available to your account. If something happens that we don't get the payment you said we simply reverse the credit and your site goes back to being a free listing again with your exact same seniority and the position you had (unless someone else purchased and jumped ahead of you). You can fill the form in either before or after you send to that address and you will find the form located <a href="make_bitcoin_payment.php?user_id='.$user_id.'">here</a>.


<p style="text-align:left;">After funding your account the only thing left to do is to select the Bid button to the left of your link. The popup will have either a checkbox if no one has purchased a link in your category yet or radio buttons if someone has. There will be more instructions there for you.
