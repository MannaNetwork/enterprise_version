<table><tr><td><h1   id="CA">Why Is The Name Of Your Bank Needed?</h1>


<p>It is in everyone's interest that the BUYER consider if they can meet the terms of the contract <b>before</b> they accept your offer rather than after. If someone agrees to buy your Advertising Credits and then fails to perform you don't lose the credits but you do lose the opportunity to sell them because once you and the BUYER have come to an agreement (and before they make a deposit) your credits are removed from the market and "deep frozen" (meaning you can not access them, spend them for advertising, redeem them for Bitcoin or cancel or edit the terms of the contract) to give the BUYER the opportunity to make the deposit as specified. 

Since the most important thing for you is that they get to your bank and make a cash deposit within the time alloted, we provide that information ahead of time so that THEY can determine if they can meet that condition. If the nearest branch of your bank is 3000 miles away from them then, obviously, they could not perform the cash deposit. There is also other information that the BUYER may find useful even if there is a branch near them including such things as the lobby hours (making cash deposits to an ATM could have varying terms and conditions between banks and branches so making the deposit to a teller is safer). 

<h2>All of the information should be available online for a BUYER once they know the bank name.</h2>
