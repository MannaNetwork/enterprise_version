echo '<p>There are basically two methods to get web traffic to your web site. One is generally referred to as the "organic" method. Wikipedia defines this as "<i>Web traffic which comes from unpaid listing at search engines or directories is commonly known as "organic" traffic. Organic traffic can be generated or increased by including the web site in directories, search engines, guides (such as yellow pages and restaurant guides), and award sites.</i>"
<p>The problem with the organic method is that it generally takes time - sometimes months or years - to see results. For example, Wikipedia further goes on to say this: "<i>Usually, the top organic result gets most of the clicks from web users. According to recent studies from the AOL search data leak, the first listing gets approximately 42% of clicks, while the number ten listing gets approximately 3% of the total clicks. The differences in web traffic generated can be staggering depending on how many searches per month your keyword generates. This indicates that it is important to appear in the top results. There are some companies which specialize in search engine marketing. However, it is becoming common for webmasters to get approached by "boiler-room" companies with no real knowledge of how to get results. As opposed to pay-per-click, search engine marketing is usually paid monthly or annually, and most search engine companies cannot promise specific results for what is paid to them.</i>"
<p>Another problem is that search engines are fickle and are forever changing their systems. Chasing after such an elusive target is not what organic is about. In fact, one reason search engines change their algorithms so often is to thwart those that do. Major search engines use hundreds of criteria to rank web sites in their results. And the amount of competition can be staggering and numbering in the many millions of other websites that, too, want to be in the top spot. Unfortunately, there is only ONE top spot.</p>
<p>Just because the method is slower doesn\'t mean to not undertake an effort to improve your site\'s organic ranking. But it is important to realize (especially for newer websites) that "time is money and, in those cases, one should consider paid web advertising just as you would consider purchasing T.V., radio or print advertising. The determining factor to consider should be, first and foremost, whether the ad will generate profits.</p>
<p>BungeeBones ads are currently one of the best advertising bargains there is. It has been in "beta testing" for a while and has a steady stream of web traffic from the network of web sites that have the web directory installed yet there has not been much marketing effort to sell the web traffic during the beta testing.
