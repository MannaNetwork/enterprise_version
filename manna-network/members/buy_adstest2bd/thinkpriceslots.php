<h1>Think "Price Slots" - Not Actual Location.</h1>
<p>When you purchase better placement you are not purchasing an exact position on a page but rather you are purchasing a position in a "price slot" which is a relative position based upon a couple of factors.The main factor is, as the name implies, price. The web directory pages display a set amount of 20 links per page and in them groups of links/websites are ordered according to the price slot they are in (from highest to lowest). If you purchase the first spot in the highest price slot your site will be displayed in the very first position on the page...until someone comes along and purchases in a higher price slot. Then your link (and its entire price slot) would drop to the number two position on the page.
<p>The next factor is seniority. Your seniority date is established when you purchase in a particular price slot. If you are the first to purchase in any price slot then yours is the senior site there and will always be displayed first among that group in whatever position your price slot ranks among the other price slots. Others can also purchase in your price slot but they will all be junior to you and will be displayed behind yours (but ahead of all lower price slots).
<h2>Micro-priced Price Slots</h2>
<p>What are Micro-priced Price Slots? The prices for each price slot are determined by a simple algorithm; that is, the next highest price slot will be one and one-half times the price of the previous one. The price slot prices start at just above a Satoshi. What is a Satoshi? It is a fraction of a Bitcoin to the eight decimal position. This means you can jump ahead of all the free links for a monthly fee that is but a miniscule fraction of a penny's worth of Bitcoin.
