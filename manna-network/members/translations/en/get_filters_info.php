            <p align="left">The visitors to the Manna Network classifieds page are able to select regional filters and retrieve links only from the selected locations. Advertisers can check how much competion they have by selecting the location they entered when they registered their ad.</p>
            <p  align="left">After you've made your selection, click the "Go" button and the bidding page will reload with ranking reports adjusted accordingly. For example, if you selected a certain city when you registered the ad, select that same city from the dropdown and the ranking reports (in the right coulumn) will report the tentative position you will receive when you purchase a particular price slot offerred in the bidding page.

<p>The basic idea is to enable advertisers that are not interested in competing with businesses around the globe to save money and to bid just enough to get the rank they desire in their own location. Bear in mind, however, that the default display to a user displays the global results. They have to actively use the filtering selection when they want to limit the results to their own area. 

<p>This feature is especially useful for local businesses that have a local market such as restaurants, barber shops, auto mechanics, lawn services etc. Advertising and competing globally for those types of businesses would be wasteful since their customers all come from the local area.
