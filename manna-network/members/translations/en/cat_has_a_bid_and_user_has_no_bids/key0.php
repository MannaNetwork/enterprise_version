NOTE: there is another empty price slot (lower priced) that will also place you in the #1 position! Strategy mostly involves your forecasts of the BitcoinSv price. If prices rise, higher paying price slots can choose to drop down to lower price slots. If prices drop, though, other advertisers are more likely to buy higher ones than yours. And how long you have been subscribed to a priceslot (i.e. seniority) also is a factor. This higher priceslot, thus, provides a hedge protecting your top position. See <a target = '_blank' href='translations/en/bidding_tips.php'>Bidding Tips</a> for more info on strategy.<span style='color:red;'>Disclaimer: Any statements regarding your position are subject to possible other purchases in this same slot made earlier than yours and/or higher priceslots bought today.</span>";
