The tanslations files for cat_has_a_bid_and_user_has_no_bids have been modifed but haven't been copied to other templates
1) Removed the display of USD value from the DMC display. We don't want to imply that DMC has any cash value
2) Also split the $daily_payment_message var into 2 and renumbered $daily_payment_message1 and $daily_payment_message2 to $daily_payment_message3 and $daily_payment_message4
