$pending_review_message = "This ad is in the queue awaiting review (before it is displayed across the network). It is normally a 24-48 hour process. You can still \"Bid for better placement\" but you won't get the position until the review process is completed. BUT a benefit of bidding now is that your site will be moved to the front of the review queue! There is also no penalty to your bid seniority caused by the review process (i.e. your bid will receive the seniority date of when you placed the bid and not the later date when it was approved).";
