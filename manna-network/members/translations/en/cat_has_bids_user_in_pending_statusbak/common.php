$blockt_message_rank = '<h3>Why position/rank is "tentative"</h3><p>Bids are processed daily and in the order that they were placed. Each bid is given a timestamp according to when it was submitted. Since it is possible for any number of bids to be placed for the same price slot we then will use their timestamp to determine their position/rank in the display. Put another way, it is possible that earlier that day someone entered a new bid in the same priceslot you selected. It is also possible for existing bids to upgrade or downgrade their bids so all quotes of a position or rank are "tentative" until processed. We don\'t report the new, unprocessed bids in our Population reports and it operates as a "sealed bid" system. Bids can be easily changed. If you don\'t get the position you wanted you can change your bid the following day but, ultimately, all positions acquired are tentative and subject to moving either up or down based on what other advertisers do. Since Bitcoin prices are volatile, advertisers should, on a regular basis, monitor their positions and the VALUE they are paying for them and compare it to the amount of traffic they receive from the network to determine their Return On Investment.';
