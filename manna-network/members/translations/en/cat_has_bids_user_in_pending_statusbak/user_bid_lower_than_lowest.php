This situation can develop when the BSV price has changed (i.e. dropped) and it requires more of them to meet the minimum price requirements (see the bottom of the page). Your bid will still be processed even though it is below the current minimum and it will still be ranked as usual. The only way you will be affected is that your current price slot will no longer be offered to new bidders so theirs will always be higher than yours. Put another way, every new bid pushes you down one position at a time. <p>Regarding processing your bid, all bids are compared daily so all positions are \"tentative\" pending the tally. Other bids in this same price slot might have already been submitted earlier today (if so, yours will be displayed just after theirs). Strategy mostly involves your forecasts of the BitcoinSv price. If prices rise, you may choose to drop down to lower price slots. If prices drop, other advertisers are more likely to buy higher ones than yours.
