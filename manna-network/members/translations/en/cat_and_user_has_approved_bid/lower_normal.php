Since it is an empty price slot then yours would have seniority over any later buyers in it. By downgrading, however, it will be easier(i.e. less expensive) for others to take the top position. Strategy mostly involves your forecasts of the BitcoinSv price. If prices rise, other higher price slots may choose to drop down to lower price slots (which would raise your position in the directory). if prices drop, other advertisers are more likely to buy higher ones than yours.
