<p class="smallerFont" >The process to buy AdCoin/advertising credits from member to member is a step by step process with minimal risks to both buyers and sellers. The process starts with sellers posting Adcoin for sale that they actually own and that are currently stored by BungeeBones.com. Each Adcoin is also fully backed with Bitcoin so users use this member to member method to sell their Bitcoin for their own local currency. It usually requires the buyer deposit cash into the seller's bank account. In the US there are certain banks where it can be done even through ATMs. 

<p class="smallerFont" >The steps are carefully described here and during the process. The software monitors each step. The process involves steps taken first by the seller, then by the buyer, and back to the seller again. Each step is critically timed to make sure the other party performs as they said they would. Time is extremely critical. It is so critical we say that "Time Is Of The Essence" which is a legal term that means if someone goes over their time by even seconds the deal is canceled (in the case of the buyer) or, in the case of the seller, the credits are automatically transferred to the buyer. 

<p class="smallerFont" >One thing computers and software can do excellently is keep track of time so once a buyer clicks to accept the seller's offer a timer starts (those time settings are set by the seller and are part of the purchase agreement). At this point the buyer has absolutely nothing to lose as they haven't paid a dime yet. What the timer does is to "freeze" the ad credits so that even the owner (i.e. the seller) cannot transfer them or cancel the sale while that timer is going. It is designed to give the buyer all the time they need to get to the bank, make the deposit and report back via a form on BungeeBones.com that the deposit has been made. That last step is crucial for the buyer. Without it the advertising credits revert back to the seller automatically. If the buyer has made the deposit and failed to report it the seller could, conceivably, cancel the sale and keep the credits and the money (time is definitely of the essence to prevent this from happening).

<p class="smallerFont" >But assuming the report was properly made then a second timer starts. The funds are still frozen but now the seller has only that amount of time specified to confirm that the buyer, did indeed, make the deposit and for the proper amount. Assuming the buyer did do their part, the ad credits will be transferred to them automatically by the BungeeBones software when the timer runs out. 

<p class="smallerFont" >It is possible, however, for the seller to cancel the transfer within this time frame. Bear in mind the credits will still continue to be frozen if they do cancel but the transaction is now filed for arbitration by BungeeBones administration. This last step is to protect the sellers from false claims of deposits by the buyers. To counter abuse by the sellers of this last step and last sliver of their privilege of ownership they are charged a fee if the ruling goes against them and for the buyer.

<p class="smallerFont" >What will make the arbitration ruling land in favor of the buyer? Well how does having the deposit receipt sound? And we suggest they also get a card with the teller's name and maybe even a snap shot of them at the bank. The only counter to that would be for the seller to produce a copy of their bank statement. If the buyer and seller have conflicting documents then one of them is a fraud or, possibly, the seller's bank has made a big mistake. Either way, the funds are still frozen while this unfortunate but hopefully never to happen event is resolved.

<p class="smallerFont" >Now that we went over all the worst case scenarios realize that, with a Smartphone and good timing, a transaction could happen in as little as five minutes. If the buyer is not worried about a prior sale or withdrawal of the ad credits from the market they could go to the bank first, without having committed to buying them. Then they could go online there, at the bank, with their phone (or maybe a laptop if wifi is available) and would click the button to agree to buy from just outside the bank. They could make the deposit and confirm the deposit all within five minutes. Assuming the seller happens to be by their computer they instantly receive the notice (because of the buyer's report) that the deposit has been made. They visit their online bank account and see the cash deposit is posted. They click a button and the ad credits are transferred to the buyer instantly by the BungeeBones software.
