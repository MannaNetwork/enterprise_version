dev Notes - while going through code to get all data submissions to be utf8 (I had been working on the AddURL class hack of this Registration class) I came back to this registration class to reiew the utf8 code and found it lacking in the second function (line 207). The method I found in forums to get it encoded was different than the one already used in the first function (line 174)

Am not sure if the differences matter and not even sure what the second function does or even if it is still used (it is a hack of the firt funtion)




line 174 (is the "database connection" function
$this->db_connection = new PDO('mysql:host='.$servername.';dbname='. $dbname, $username, $password, 
  array(
    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
    PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => "SET NAMES utf8"));

AND/OR

line 207 is the database connection limited function

$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host='.$servername.';dbname='.$dbname, $username, $password.';charset=utf8');
      $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);    
      $pdo->setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false );          
      $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
                return true;
